# README for figures & stats in Viceroy manuscript

## Stats
+ Section: Species abundance across Florida
    + Topic: abundances
    + Method: We are using count data to predict count data; Poisson regression
    See: http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/generalized-linear-models-in-r-part-6-poisson-regression-count-variables/
        + Viceroys & willows in all sites - what are these tests?
        + Viceroy abundance ~ Queen abundance
        + Queen abundance ~ twinevine abundance
+ Section: Viceroy butterfly and larval host plant chemical defenses
    + Topic: chemistry
    + Note: Much of these appear to have been t-tests; North vs. South.
    We can use actual abundances rather than categorization?
    + Method: Linear regression
        + Viceroy total (non-volatile) phenolics ~ Queen abundance
        + Viceroy salicin ~ Queen abundance
        + Viceroy salicortin ~ Queen abundance
        + Viceroy tremulacin ~ Queen abundance
        + Total volatile phenolics ~ Queen abundance
        + Benzaldhyde ~ Queen abundance
        + Salicylaldehyde ~ Queen abundance
        + Willow total (non-volatile) phenolics ~ Queen abundance
        + Willow salicin ~ Queen abundance
        + Willow salicortin ~ Queen abundance
        + Willow tremulacin ~ Queen abundance
+ Section: Predator behavioral responses to viceroy butterflies
    + Topic: predator behavior
    + Note: Much of these appear to have been t-tests; North vs. South.
    We can use actual abundances rather than categorization?
    + Method: Linear regression
        + Aversion learning ~ Queen abundance
        + Memory retention ~ Queen abundance
